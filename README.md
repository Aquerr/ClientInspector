## General
Client Inspector is a Forge mod that allows you to execute commands on a player 
who connects to the server with disallowed mods. It also logs information about such events in its own log file.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Aquerr/ClientInspector/wiki) to get to know how everything works.
